Overflow the buffer so that you modify the return value of the %eip which is the return call for the main function when you do a objdump -d overflow2 | grep "804851b"
Replace the original return memory address with the value of the shell memory address above and leave %ebp untouched (this requires you to manually type in "\x98\xd6\xff\xff"

NOTES: EIP and EBP are stack and heap registers
