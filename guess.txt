I think I got lucky on this.

Basically, I tried to leak the memory addresses first (three in fact) to correspond with each variable secret, guess, and name.
I believe that after leaking the memory addresses, C is now pointing to the secret and with a simple string formatted %d, I was able to leak the secret.

The secret varies since it is randomized every time.

Hello! What is your name?

I generated a random 32-bit number.
