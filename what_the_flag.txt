It is best to use the interactive console for this since it automatically helps you print hexadecimals.

For this problem, you have to send in the correct password and modify the pointer file_name to somewhere down the line.
What I mean is that the default file is not_the_flag.txt
The goal is to make the file_name pointer point to 'f' instead of 'n'.

This is done by shifting the first set in the hexademical down 8 digits from 77 -> 7f
Also, note that gets() does not terminate the string, so you have to specify the terminating null after the password.

$ printf "1337_P455W0RD\x00\x00\x00\x7f\x87\x04\x08" | ./what_the_flag
Congratulations! Here is the flag: who_needs_%eip
