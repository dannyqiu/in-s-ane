Basically, you want to bet a negative amount so that if you lose, you gave money. Normally, the getnum() function will not let you input negative numbers, but remember that data types "loop around". Therefore, after it reaches its maximum capacity, it becomes negative.

The return of getnum() is based on the primitive uint64_t
This is just a regular int of 4 bytes. To overflow it and cause it to loop around, simply input a number a bit more than 2^31, I used 2147483649 (1 more than 2^31)

Yerr can't bet more than ya got!
You've got $50. How much you wanna bet on this next toss?
