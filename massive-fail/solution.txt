If you look at the two files (since they were pointed out in the hint), you'll see that the controllers creates a user with all the parameters given from the html form.

So, you look at the schema.db for the attributes that the User has and the one that you want to change is is_admin to true

In the register form, simply add an input for this attribute to be sent to the server, with the syntax following that of the other inputs

<input name="user[is_admin]" type="text" value="true">
